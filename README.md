# F1 Discord bot

Limited bot(for now) that will provide information for the next race.

# Dependencies

Run the following commands and the script should run without problems.

`npm install jsdom`

`npm install jquery`

`npm install discord.js`

After that, take the token_example.json. Rename it to token.json and place your token in the quotes that say "YOUR ID HERE".

If you now run the script by typing "node script.js" in your terminal the bot should come online and function.
